    "### 8. Conclusion\n",
    "- Model Diagnostics\n",
    "    - The best-performing model achieved a respectable Adjusted R² of approximately 0.84, indicating a strong overall fit.\n",
    "    - However, diagnostic plots reveal systematic issues in the residuals, particularly at the extremes of the predicted values.\n",
    "    -  Specifically, the variance of residuals is not constant across all fitted values—violating the assumption of homoscedasticity—suggesting the model struggles to make consistent predictions across the full price range.\n",
    "- Potential Improvements\n",
    "    - Transformation of the target variable (e.g. log transformation)\n",
    "    - Tree based based models (e.g. random forest) or GLMs"
